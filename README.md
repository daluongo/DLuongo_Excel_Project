Organized and analyzed an Excel database of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover any trends in what makes a project successfully meeting or exceeding funding goals. This was done by analyzing the data through pivot tables and displaying the findings using pivot charts.
Several conclusions were drawn from the data analysis:
  One conclusion we can draw is that Kickstarter campaigns related to journalism are not successful at all, to date. 
  A second conclusion is that Kickstarter campaigns that started in May were more successful than campaigns that started in any other month   during the time represented. 
  A third conclusion that can be drawn is that theatre campaigns, particularly plays, were the most successful Kickstarter campaigns during   the time represented.
